    <p>Pertussis, known as whooping cough is a disease caused by a bacterium, it mostly affects children by damaging the respiratory tract.
      The whooping cough virus is mostly common in infants, but people of all ages could contract it.
      At first, whooping cough causes mild cold-like symptoms that last for 1 to 2 weeks, such as a runny nose, sneezing, a low-grade fever,fatigue,a mild cough,watery eyes.
      After some time people start to develop a chronic cough that sounds like a whoop, which is where the virus gets its name from.
      This disease is not common in the United States because most US citizens are given a vaccine for it when we are born, to prevent us from contracting it.
      Even though this disease isn't as common in the US, many people suffer from it in other areas.</p>
