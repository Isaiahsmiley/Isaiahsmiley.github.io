                        <h2>Why?</h2>
                        <p>Pertussis is a serious and deadly disease that could easily be prevented by a simple vaccination.
                          You probably rarely hear anything about this disease because it isn’t common in the US, due to vaccinations we are provided when we are young.
                          Unfortunately, not everyone in the world has access to such vaccines.
                          Low income communities in and out of the US aren’t able to access this vaccine because its either not in reach or way to expensive to afford.</p>

                        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                        <p>Our solution to this problem is to create a free portable clinic for anyone could have access to a vaccine.
                          This portable clinic will have reusable needles to save money, but will be professional clean to prevent others from getting sick.
                          For our idea to work it has to be able to go world wide because there are many places in the world that is desperately in need.
                          Since we are a non-profit organization, the way we will fund this is through fundraisers and donations.</p>
